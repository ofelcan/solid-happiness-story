Joey was a young lad living in the acient Wisconsin wilderness. Each day he would wake up and take a trip down to the stream to wash up and drink. One day he spotted a curious looking black and yellow bird. Joey was intrigued so he waded through the stream and started after the bird. It was only a few hundred feet away. The magnificent bird starred at him as he approached.

The bird told Joey that it is from a nearby village and would like to host Joey there for a dinner. Joey followed the bird to the village and found that all villagers were friendly, but dressed in medieval fashions. They treated Joey pretty well and told him not to let others know the existence of this village.

Joey asked the locals why the village was stuck in the middle ages, and they responded with confused looks on their faces. "What do you mean by the middle ages," one villager asked. Joey then proceeded to ask them what year it was, only to be shocked to find out that it was 1551. Joey looked around for the bird to ask him how he had brought him to the past, but the bird was nowhere to be found. 

He looked around the village and saw a man that looked frightenly like his father. Joey began realize what had happened. This man was his great great great great great great great great great grandfather. The bird had taken Joey back in time and had left him stranded.
