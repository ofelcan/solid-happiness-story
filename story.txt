Joey was a young lad living in the acient Wisconsin wilderness. Each day he would wake up and take a trip down to the stream to wash up and drink. One day he spotted a curious looking black and yellow bird. Joey was intrigued so he waded through the stream and started after the bird. It was only a few hundred feet away. The magnificent bird starred at him as he approached.

The bird told Joey that it is from a nearby village and would like to host Joey there for a dinner. Joey followed the bird to the village and found that all villagers were friendly, but dressed in medieval fashions. They treated Joey pretty well and told him not to let others know the existence of this village.
